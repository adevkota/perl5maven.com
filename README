These are the source files of the articles published on http://perl5maven.com/
Copyright Gabor Szabo except where the =author field explicitly shows someone else.


FORMAT
-------
The format has evolved from POD, HTML and Docbook. It is now a mess. I know. I'll have to clean that up.

The overview:

In the header there are

  =key value

pairs of meta information.

The text between

  =abstract start

  =abstract end

is displayed on the front pages and is included in the RSS/Atom feed.


For internal titles  <h2> is used
<hl></hl> stands for highlight and usually code-snippets inside the text are marked with these.
Other imporant pieces are marked with <b></b>

Code snippets are wrapped in 

  <code lang="perl">
  </code>



PROMOTION
----------

When articles are published they are posted to Google+, Twitter and sometimes even to Facebook.
They are also posted on LinkedIN.

An e-mail is sent out to the people who registered on the Perl 5 Maven site.

Many of the articles are included the Perl Weekly newsletter.


Once in a while I post a link to Reddit ( http://www.reddit.com/ )
but I'd rather see others post there if they find the article worth the mention.
The same with Hacker News: https://news.ycombinator.com/


SEO explained in 5 words
------------------------
"Get links from trusted sources" ~ Jon Morrow

The best promotion is if people find it worth to mention one
of the articles in a blog post or in some other form.

Mailing list
-------------
There is an invitation only, but publicly archived mailing list
for the the people who would like to contribute to the Perl Maven
site. A couple of ways to contribute:
- translate an article to a language
- proofreading in any language (including English)
- promote the articles in one or more languages
- site design
- site code (once it becomes open source)
- write original content for the English site

The mailing list can be found here:

http://mail.perlmaven.com/mailman/listinfo/perlmaven-contributor

If you'd like to participate, please contact Gabor.


TRANSLATIONS - LOCALIZATION
---------------------------
Translations used to have their own repository, but they were integrated
into this repository. Some of the README might still be in the old state.

Initial language codes were a bit random, but we will try to stick to
the way Wikipedia describes: https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wikipedias

English                 en  (the 'original' files)
Chinese (Mainland)      cn
Chinese (Taiwan)        tw
Esperanto               eo
French                  fr
German                  de
Hebrew                  he
Indonesian              id
Italian                 it
Korean                  ko
Nepali                  ne
Portuguese (Brazilian)  br     (sorry Bretons)
Romaninan               ro
Russiona                ru
Spanish                 es



*) The file names (that become the URLs) should be in LOCAL_LANGUAGE, but use only ASCII characters.
   Transliterated to English. (I am not sure in this. Maybe a better thing would be to use LOCAL_LANGUAGE in the URLs?)
   http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=182192 .
*) The file names should more-or-less match the title of the page, they can contain words separated with dashes.
*) Please add the header to each file (the meta information) including the planned publication date
*) The links in the page should be working. If there is already a translation for the target page then link there,
    if it only exists in English, then please use full URLs including the hostname http://perl5maven.com/ .
*) Please update the hidden(!) section of the perl-tutorial.tt to include the links to the entries.
*) The text listing the author and the translator are added by the system and are driven from the header
   tags =author and =translator.
*) Each author and translator has to have an entry in the authors.txt file listing a nickname (\w characters only),
   The full name, the name of the image file containing their picture, link to their G+ profiles.
*) Each author and translator needs to provide a picture in jpg or png format approximately 128x128 pixel size 
   (an Avatar) to be shown at the bottom of each article.
*) Each author and translator should set up authorship by linking their Google+ profile to the CC.perl5maven.com
   site. (e.g. br.perl5maven.com for the Brazilian Porguguese translators)
   See http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=1408986


Trnslation process (that will work for the pages of the Perl tutorial but not for other pages).
*) The translator creates a new file in the sites/CC/drafts folder.
*) When s/he has finished the translations s/he adds the link to the translation from the perl-tutorials.tt file in a comment.

*) Gabor can then easily see which translations are ready and can move them one-by-one to the sites/CC/pages/ directory,
   enable the entry in the perl-tutorials.tt file, update the date and publish the new article.


Comments
--------
We use https://disqus.com/ as the commenting system. The English version is moderated by Gabor.
If you'd like to enable comments on your language and if you are willing to moderate it then
please create an account on https://disqus.com/ and tell Gabor about it.

Moderation requires that you follow all the comments that arrive to the site and see if they need
any attention. Spams are usually filtered by Disqus, but a few can slip through and there can be
an occassional false positive, something that is marked as spam but it isn't really.
The moderator also has to make sure that the comments stay civil and not hesitate to remove
irrelevant or offending comments.


Promotions
-----------

The translators also need to take on themselves a large part of the promotion in the language communities.
Both in the Perl community - to get help from others - and to the general public.

This can be by posting on the language sub-Reddit (e.g. on http://www.reddit.com/r/Romania )

Sharing the articles on Google+, Twitter and Facebook should be almost automatic.

Getting the RSS feed of the site to be included in some local 'planets'.



Git and Github
---------------

There is good and free book about Git called Git Pro http://git-scm.com/book

Install Git on you desktop
configure username and password
generate ssh key: https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys


Create a Github account, let's say your username is USERNAME:
Upload the ssh key to your account
On Github 'fork' the https://github.com/szabgab/perl5maven.com repository
It will create another repository https://github.com/USERNAME/perl5maven.com

clone it to your desktop:
$ git clone git@github.com:USERNAME/perl5maven.com.git

It will create a directory called perl5maven.com inside all the source files.
There should be one called sites/CC  (where CC is your language code
based on this list: https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wikipedias
more or less).  If there is no such directory ask Gabor to create one.

Initially you will need to know about
$ git add  filename
$ git commit -m "message"
$ git push

And on Github there is a button to "Send Pull request" that will
notify me to look at what you pushed, but of course I am also available
by e-mail and GTalk.
